      How many times have you come home from your shopping, only to find out you already had 4
      cans of pickled eggs in your pantry (we are not judging...)?
      <br /><br />
      <strong>FEAR NO MORE!</strong>
      <br /><br />
      With <strong>Credenza</strong> (it means "pantry" in Italian), you can finally keep track of your items at home, so you won't buy extra food you don't need (or want).
